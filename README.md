Quick options to turn on [debugger](https://github.com/transparenceweb/tealium-bookmarklets/blob/main/activate-debugger.js) for TIQ, check the [current environment and version](https://github.com/transparenceweb/tealium-bookmarklets/blob/main/current-environment-and-version-checker.js) to make sure you are viewing the latest change, and a more detailed script to [duplicate Eventstream Event Feeds based on GUID](https://github.com/transparenceweb/tealium-bookmarklets/blob/main/event-feed-duplicator.js).
